<h1>Tic Tac Toe: The Classic Strategy Game</h1>
<p>Tic Tac Toe is a classic strategy game for two players. The game is played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking the squares with an X or an O. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all nine squares are filled and no player has three in a row, the game is a tie.</p>
